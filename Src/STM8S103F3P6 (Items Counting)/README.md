# Automatic Items Counter on STM8-based Conveyor
Automatic items counter is a fast and precise tool for humans to get the sum of items. The purpose of this project is to provide education to the wider community on how to make a simple automatic item counter. This project has been implemented and took approximately 1 day. This system is made to be used as a complement to the conveyor. In addition, this system has also provided display and reset features for the needs of its users. The way this system works is that if the items transported by the conveyor are right in front of the laser beam, the light intensity received by the LDR sensor is low, so it is considered that there are items and starts counting. The calculation results will be displayed on the LCD screen. This project will be useful for business people, because it can increase efficiency in production. The results show that this system can function properly.

## ST-Link/V2 Setup
<img width="840" src="Assets/Documentation/Experiment/ST-Link Configuration.jpg" alt="stlink-configuration"><br><br>

<h3><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/932b96eb-cbc7-42f1-8938-43cb431889a5" width="16" height="16"> Notes :</h3>
<blockquote>
   <ul>
   <li>
   
   The single wire interface module or ``` SWIM ``` is basically used to communicate with the ``` STM8 ``` board.

   </li>
   <li>
   
   You can see the wiring between the ``` ST-Link/V2 ``` and the ``` STM8 ``` board in detail in the picture above.
   
   </li>
   <li>
   
   Based on personal experience, the ``` STM8 ``` can only be programmed with ``` ST-Link ```.
   
   </li>
   </ul>

<br><br>

## FTDI USB Setup

<h3><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/932b96eb-cbc7-42f1-8938-43cb431889a5" width="16" height="16"> Notes :</h3>
<blockquote>
   <ul>
   <li>
   
   Serial communication on this ``` STM8 ``` board is very possible, especially for ``` Serial Monitor ``` and ``` Serial Plotter ``` purposes. Tools that can be used for serial communication include: ``` CP2102 USB ```, ``` CH340 USB ```, ``` FTDI USB ```, or with ``` PL2303 USB ```.

   </li>
   <li>
   
   You can see the wiring between the ``` FTDI USB ``` and the ``` STM8 ``` board in detail in the picture above.
   
   </li>
   <li>
   
   Based on experience, I admit that using ``` FTDI USB ``` or ``` CP2102 USB ``` is much better than ``` PL2303 USB ``` or ``` CH340 USB ``` because they are known to be more stable in performance.
   
   </li>
   </ul>

## Removing write protection on STM8
The write protection on the ``` STM8 ``` can be removed through several steps, among others :<br><br>
1. Connect the ``` STM8 ``` to the ``` ST-Link/V2 ```, then connect the ``` ST-Link/V2 ``` to a PC or laptop.<br><br>

2. Open ``` CMD (Command Prompt) ```.<br><br>

3. Enter into the directory :

   <table><tr><td width="810">
      
      ``` C:\Users\[Computer Name]\AppData\Local\Arduino15\packages\sduino\tools\STM8Tools\2019.02.05\win ```

   </td></tr></table><br>

4. Input the command:

   <table><tr><td width="810">
      
      ```
      stm8flash -cstlinkv2 -pstm8s103?3 -u
      ```

   </td></tr></table><br>
   
5. Press ``` Enter ```, then you can see the result as the picture below.
