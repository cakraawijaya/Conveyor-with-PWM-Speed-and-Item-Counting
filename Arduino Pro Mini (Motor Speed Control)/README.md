# Arduino Pro Mini-based Conveyor Motor Speed Control System using PWM Method
Conveyor is a mechanical system used to move goods or materials from one place to another that is carried out continuously. The purpose of this project is to provide education to the wider community on how to make a simple mini conveyor. This project has been implemented and takes approximately 1 week. To adjust how fast the conveyor machine can move, you can use a potentiometer. To change the direction of movement of the conveyor machine as well as stop it, you can use a push button. The benefit of making this project is none other than to add insight. The results show that this system can function properly.

## Arduino IDE Setup
1. Open the ``` Arduino IDE ``` first, then open this project by clicking ``` File ``` -> ``` Open ``` : 

   <table><tr><td width="810">
   
      ``` pwm_conveyor.ino ```

   </td></tr></table><br>
   
2. ``` Board Setup ``` in Arduino IDE

   <table>
      <tr><th width="810">

      How to setup the ``` Arduino Pro Mini ``` board
            
      </th></tr>
      <tr><td width="810">
      
      Select a board by clicking: ``` Tools ``` -> ``` Board ``` -> ``` Arduino AVR Boards ``` -> ``` Arduino Pro or Pro Mini ```

      </td></tr>
   </table><br>

3. ``` Change Processor ``` in Arduino IDE

   <table><tr><td width="810">
      
      Click ``` Tools ``` -> ``` Processor ``` -> ``` ATmega328P (5V, 16 MHz) ```

   </td></tr></table><br>

4. ``` Port Setup ``` in Arduino IDE

   <table><tr><td width="810">
      
      Click ``` Port ``` -> Choose according to your device port ``` (you can see in device manager) ```

   </td></tr></table><br>

5. Before uploading the program please click: ``` Verify ```.<br><br>

6. If there is no error in the program code, then please click: ``` Upload ```.<br><br>

7. Some things you need to do when using the ``` Arduino Pro Mini board ``` with ``` PL2303 USB ``` :

   <table><tr><td width="810">

      • ``` Arduino IDE ``` information: ``` Uploading... ``` -> immediately press the ``` RESET ``` button and release it.
      
      • Wait until the message appears: ```Done Uploading ``` -> ```The program is directly operated ```.

   </td></tr></table><br>

8. If there is still a problem when uploading the program, then try checking the ``` driver ``` / ``` port ``` / ``` others ``` section.

<blockquote>
   <ul>
   <li>
   
   This ``` Arduino Pro Mini ``` is not equipped with a ``` USB port ```, so you need an additional device in the form of a ``` USB to TTL Serial ``` to connect to a laptop or PC. ``` USB to TTL Serial ``` like the ``` PL2303 USB ``` is commonly used as an intermediate medium for uploading programs.
   
   </li>
   <li>
   
   You can see the wiring between the ``` PL2303 USB ``` and the ``` Arduino Pro Mini ``` board in the picture above.
   
   </li>
   <li>
   
   To upload a program, in addition to using the ``` PL2303 USB ```, you can also use other programming tools such as: ``` CP2102 USB ```, ``` CH340 USB ```, or with ``` FTDI USB ```. Based on experience, I admit that using ``` FTDI USB ``` or ``` CP2102 USB ``` is much better than ``` PL2303 USB ``` or ``` CH340 USB ``` because they are known to be more stable in performance.
   
   </li>
   </ul>
